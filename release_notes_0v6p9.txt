===================================================================
Version 0v6p9 -- 27may2020
===================================================================

to do...

	maybe add RtdfObjects to .RTDF files...
	... to track what objects are present/valid

	ConvertStdf
	- add flag for multiple limit values
      ge vs gt complicates things...
	  what data object to use?
	  also add LimitsIndexMatrix, same size as results
  	  ** would need to revisit all merge/manipulate routines
	  ? what to do with PlotRtdf...
	  ... maybe add function to extract ParametersFrame for a particular part?
	      (could search for unique parts
      ... ok, generate multiple rtdf files based on limits
    - try to intelligently order the ParametersFrame...

    FilterByResults
    - started adding code to expand filtering, but not done!
      + remove result and all subsequent results
      + remove result and following number of results (ie next 9 tests)

	finish integrating python xlsx script
	- converts .csv to .xlsx with color formatting for failed results
    that are dynamically determined by limits columns.

    PlotRtdfGui
	- make file list section Yscrollbar for laptops and many files
	  .. a lot harder than you would expect this to be!
	  (not 100% sure it is possible yet)
	- need to update PDF to include limits+10%, alt2_lim, count=fails

	finish PlotRtdf_v2

	SanityCheck
	- started on script that checks for internal consistency and any missing
	  bits in an RTDF file.  To help debug issues when writing scripts that
	  generate RTDF files as outputs

	ShrinkRetests.R
	- started adding feature to keep last PASS not last run, but didn't finish

	SplitConditions
    - it uses all 'extra' fields in DevicesFrame.
      maybe have it extract list and let you chose all or just some?

	StackedWaferMap
	- created script, but no GUI yet... had little script that called it.
    - also need to add to documentation!

	YieldAdjust
	- start on conceptualizing this..  adjust limits and re-generate binning results



New Scripts:
=============
- NonGating2Gating
    Post process an RTDF file, updating the binning information for a test that
    was run non-gating, but you now want to make gating.

- PlotRtdf_2
	A more complicated, but more flexible version of PlotRtdf
	(not done yet, but basically working for one use case of multiple histograms)

- ProbeVsReprobe
	For wafer probe files that contain die that have been reprobed, it will
	generate a CSV file with first probe bin counts and overall bin counts 
	for all sites and then for each site separately

- XYWid2Partid
    overwrite DevicesFrame part_id with either DevicesFrame: Xcoord,Ycoord,
	Wafer_id, or pull from ParametersFrame/ResultsMatrix for testnames (substr) specified
	
- XformWaferMapGui
	Enhance the WaferMap script to also support coordinate translation.  At the GUI level,
   	hide these added options in WaferMap, and include them in XformWaferMap.  both
	GUi scripts call the same underlying RADAR script.

- StackedWaferMap
	(but only started the StackedWaferMapGui.R, didn't finish it)
    (need to add to documentation also!)


Improvements and Fixes:
=======================
- AsciiWaferMap
	* now handles files from IFlex that have some missing SbinInfoFrame entries

	* add option to NOT suppress alarmed measurements
	* fix dropped byte at 100MByte page boundaries
	* add option to NOT verify matching PTR/FTR/MPR for each TSR.  Verification had

	* for 93k, support CONDITION: as well as CONDITION=
	* only add "no_pin" when absolutely necessary
	* fix some bugs that would show up if processing DTR records
	* add do_FTR_fail_cycle option.  for FTR records, instead of putting the flag byte into the RTDF,

- FilterByResult
	* supports TestFlagMatrix object

- FindFirstFailsGui
    * fix bug in list decrement in gui

- MergeRtdf
	* fix a few bugs when merging multiple wafers
	* fix a few bugs when first rtdf doesn't have a TestFlagMatrix object, or
      crashes if TestFlagMatrix size doesn't match ResultsMatrix size
	
- PlotRtdf
    * change warning decision from >2000 plots to a passed-in variable.  
      allows non-interactive scripting for datasets with >2K tests
	* add plot option to plot to limits +10%
	* add option to display count outside limits vs. off the plot
    * add support for 2nd set of alternate limits, so you can now have
      ws/ft/qc limits

 	  partial wafer probe sessions (due to duplicate entries in WaferInfoFrame)
	  now uses unique wafer indices in DevicesFrame to determine # of wafers
	  in file.
    * if die per wafer is >=7000, suppress default black border around each die
	  in the wafermap
	* properly displays bin info when >8 pass bins
    * can now assign specific colors for sbins to maintain consistent color
      scheme across wafers


===================================================================
Version 0v6p8 -- 2Aug2014
===================================================================

Improvements and Fixes:
=======================
- ConvertStdf
  * add auto_flex flag, to strip out channel numbers from flex
    testnames to keep them common between sites
  * remove trailing whitespace from wafer_id if it is present
  * deal with flex TSR's where "<> comment..." is missing compared to
    matching PTR
  * add support for Advantest T2000 files
    - MPR 2nd+ occurrences without testnames and without pinlists
    - TSR/SBR/HBR site_num/head_num convention for "all_sites"
  * add an enVision variant to DTR parsing
  * fix parsing hiccups that occur at 100MByte boundaries 
    (introduced in previous update to handle large stdf files)
  * now tracks and gives a warning with the number of unknown records
  * suppress warnings about LTX HFi gratuitous "PATTERNS" TSRs
  * add workaround fix for 93K bug for corrupt FTR for failing test... having
    a modulo 8 =0 number of pins resulted in an extra byte inserted in record.
    
- ConvertEDL
  * resolve warnings with newer versions of R
  * deal with Linux based EDL files that have Site lines before
    Start Testflow lines
  * add sublot_id support
  * fix bug so start_t gets properly populated
  * append pat_label to some functional testnames
  * fix bug that occurred if all results for a test were undefined 
  
- SplitWafers
  * now deals with multiple occurrences of the same waferid,
    appends _run2, etc to filenames for repeat occurrences
    
- WaferMap
  * now allows customization of parametric wafer map coloring
  * for parametric maps, now gracefully handles if WaferMapGui tclvalue()
    stripped off trailing whitespace from the testname
  * fix bug where hbin pass/fail flag wasn't pulling info from HbinInfoFrame
   
- PlotTestvsTest
  * now gracefully handles if PlotTestvsTestGui tclvalue()
    stripped off trailing whitespace from the testnames

- FilterByResult
  * now gracefully handles if FilterByResultGui tclvalue() 
    stripped off trailing whitespace from the testname
    
- TkRadar
  * ... dir vs filename if browse for dir first.. behaviour changed

- ConvertCsvGui  
  * switch directory browser to start where the last Rtdf file was,
    not the Rtdfs_dir directory
  * update an internal variable name to be less confusing
  	csv_in_dir --> csv_out_csv_dir... directory to write csv file to
  * fix bug where it would occasionally get confused when creating
    transposed csv files.  ("r2c" vs. "r2ct" directory/filename tracking)
    
    
===================================================================
Version 0v6p7 -- 8Dec2013
===================================================================

		
New Scripts:
=============
- NSIS installer script for Windows users

- FilterByIndices
   This script replaces RemoveDevicesAtIndices.  It allows you to Keep or Remove
   or Report the devices at the specified indices.  It also accepts a logic
   indices array, in which case it recycles the array.  (ie  c(T,F,F,F) to select
   every 4th device)
   
- FindFirstFails
	This script will add (or overwrite) 2 fields in the DevicesFrame, 
	
- Fingerprint
	This script will look at tests that have very good device vs. population resolution
	to determine if the part_ids have been scrambled or the parts mixed up.  Useful
	when sanitizing 1000 hour HTOL pulls, etc.  It can use either a list of tests to use,
    or 2 reference RTDF data sets with matching parts to determine the list.

- PlotVsRun
   Variant of the control chart without the control chart focus.
   Allows you to plot several datasets/files per test in a 
   result vs. time/run order fashion

- Rtdf2Deducer
   Combines information from the ParametersFrame, DevicesFrame and ResultsMatrix
   into a single Frame that Deducer can readily deal with.  
   - filters testnames to have only Deducer acceptable characters
   - appends testnames and units to Results column names
   - Combines DevicesFrame and ResultsMatrix into a single Frame


Improvements and Fixes:
=======================
- ConvertStdf
  * Extract summary info from PRR records and add to .summary file
  * add Hbin summary info to .summary file
  * add Sbin per site info to .summary file
  * add Sbin per site objects to RTDF
  * Fix bug where it read U4 as I4, resolves warnings about readBin() doesn't
    support U4
  * Fix bug with 93k data, if auto_93k flag but no valid results for test
  * Add default endian option to GUI, set to "little" for Flex stdf files
    occasionally have DTR records before the FAR record. (tsk, tsk)
  * Add DTR record parsing to extract "trace_id" (specific user case)
    also switch readChar() to rawToChar() to handle 'nul' inside strings
  * read Stdf file in 100MB chunks rather than the whole thing
    should resolve windows 500MB limit, and the signed int 2.2GB limit
    1.3Gb stdf ran 13.41 minutes with 100MB chunks
    1.3Gb stdf ran 13.36 minutes with 1300MB chunk... so negligible impact!
  * modify code to deal with occasional -1 for sbin_count from 93K 7.x.
    The code now violates standard, but not issue if sbin_count < 4billion,
    so should be ok for a while :)
  * Add optional max_count that only extracts the data for the first n devices,
    can speed things up on huge files with "too much information"
  * Add ll_ge and ul_ge flag fields to ParametersFrame
  * Add job_rev field to LotInfoFrame
  * Fix bug where WafersFrame wasn't being reinitialized.  Impacted you if you 
    processed a multiwafer stdf file followed by an stdf file with less wafers.
  * Add auto_demangle flag. Occasionally stdf files get corrupted moving between 
    Microsoft and other OS's, either by inserting 0x0d's before occurrences of
    0x0a's or removing 0x0d's from 0x0d then 0x0a sequences.  Setting this flag
    will enable the detection and attempted repair of cases where 0x0d's have 
    been removed.  (ie.  if dos2unix was unintentionally run on the stdf file)
  
- FilterByResultGui
    numeric value entry is now in gui, not in popup window. 
  
- LoadRtdf / SaveRtdf
	Add support for Sbin per-site objects
	    
- PlotRtdf
	Add option for 2-sided robust statistics

- ConvertCsv / Gui
  * add default variable (also to .Rprofile) to set default radiobutton
    to either rows=tests or cols=tests
  * fix bug that occurred in rtdf->csv with cols=tests and multiple test
    conditions where conditions contained unusual characters like []:;,
  * add option to put start_t and finish_t from the LotInfoFrame portion
    in ascii rather than posix time
  * add option to include ul_eq_pass/ll_eq_pass fields in .csv file (aka ll_ge
    and ul_ge fields in ParametersFrame in rtdf)
  * add job_rev field to LotInfoFrame section
  * add auto_open flag, so ideally your default spreadsheet opens up once the
    conversion has finished.
    
- SplitConditions
  * Updated to support ConvertStdf additional DevicesFrame fields of
    "trace_id" and "device_id"
    
- PlotTestvsTest
  * sets x,y scales based on parts that have both valid x and valid y data
    makes it a bit more immune to bad data points
  * add option to explicitly set x/y min/max plot limits
        	
- TkRadarDefaultsGui
  * add "delete" option to Settings File popup
  * add ConvertCsv default variables
  
- MergeRtdf
  * add support for ll_ge and ul_ge fields of ParametersFrame
  * more robust merging of LotInfoFrame
  * add support for WafersFrame, wafer_id when merging
  
  
===================================================================
Version 0v6p6 -- 3April2012
===================================================================

New Scripts:
=============
- ConvertEagleCSV.R
	Add support for Eagle ETS-500 ascii csv .log datalog format
	* add support for duplicate testnames by optionally appending
	  testnumbers, similar to ConvertStdf.R
	* generate .summary from .log, similar to ConvertStdf.R

- Convert9470CSV.R
	Add support for csv format generated by HP9472 testers

- ConvertETS.R
	Add support for Eagle ETS-300 ascii datalog format

- ConvertKDF.R
	Add support for Keithley tester's ascii datalog format
	
- RemoveAtXY.R
	93K occasionally adds bogus die at X=-1,y=-1 in data files...
	This script just removes them so wafermaps come out ok.


Improvements and Fixes:
=======================
- TkRadar.R
	for Vista/Windows7, directory browser now opens in intended directory,
	not top level "Computer" folder

- MergeRtdf.R
	fixed bug with row.names in merged DevicesFrame that would
	stop you from easily viewing the DevicesFrame.

- PlotRtdf.R and Gui
	add option to just have superimposed histograms rather than
	individual histograms + superimposed histogram

	add option to have normal probability plots rather than histograms

	add option to create plots in .png files per test rather than single .pdf

	split checkboxes into 2 columns instead of one.  This makes the
	window not quite as tall, so it works better on laptops.

- AsciiWaferMap.R
	fixed bug that caused script to crash if wafer was less
	than 5 die wide

- ConvertStdf.R
	On LTX/Cx modified so it reports the TSR's for the first TSR site it
	encounters, since, at least in single site, there isn't an overall
	summary TSR record.   This probably breaks LTX/Cx multi-site, but no
	examples to work from.

	Add explicit support for Eagle:
	- Tweak Duplicate_testnames to work with Eagle STDF files, since only
	  first PTR has testname, rest just have testnum.
	- Remove first device if it is bogus (just PTR's with testnames, 
	  silly data

	Add ability to generate TestFlagMatrix as well as ResultsMatrix.  
	TestFlagMatrix contains pass/fail flag information on a per test
	basis.  0=pass, 1=pass alternate limits, 2=fail, 4=invalid, NaN=
	test was not run.

	fix typo in ConvertStdfGui window... do_conditions

	For 93000, use TSR's if site=0 for all sites summary.  (STDF standard
	is site=255 for all sites)

- ConvertEDL.R
	now pull Wafer ID from EDL file if it is present.
	better tolerate applicat's that put <cr> in lotid strings, etc.

- ConvertHP9400 renamed to ConvertHP9490
	HP9470's are completely different systems than HP9490's, so this
	is to resolve that confusion.  NOTE HP9490 ascii format should
	be similar to HP94000 ascii format.

- TkRadarDefaultsGui.R
	add support for ConvertEagleCSVGui default settings


===================================================================
Version 0v6p5 -- 11Dec10
===================================================================


New Features:
=============
- SplitBySubstr.R
	This script provides an alternate method of dealing with test conditions
	by encoding them in the testnames separated by underscores.

- ConvertFrugal.R
	Add support for the Frugal tester's ascii datalog format

- ConvertHP9400.R
	Add support for HP9400 tester's ascii datalog format

- TkRadar.R
	Added button to bring up PDF documentation


Improvements and Fixes:
=======================
- PlotRtdfGui.R, WaferMapGui.R ControlChartGui.R
	scripts that generate pdf file outputs can now automatically
	open the PDF file in your default PDF viewer when done

- AsciiWaferMap.R and Gui.R
	now has option to do map of bin values, rather than just 1's and x's.  This
	enables multiple variant assembly... (ie assemble all bin 1's into one 
	sublot, all bin 7's into a second sublot)
	also added a terse mode so only some of the bins are shown, the rest
	stay as x's.

	added option which tries to determine which untested die coordinates are 
	on the wafer and use the "-" character instead of the "." character
	for these die.  (makes the alignment for some pick'n'place machines smoother)

	also fixed bug where it was grabbing hardbin pass/fail info from softbin
	frame instead of hardbin frame

- ConvertCsvGui.R
	fixed bug where it got confused about input directory when
	doing Csv-to-Rtdf and the Csv directory was the default, but
	the Rtdf one was not.

- ConvertCsv.R
	now properly handles units if they are "NA"

	now handles bad or missing finish_t value in LotInfoFrame

	now force some CSV fields to as.numeric when reading in to avoid
	rude crashes on occasional bad data

- ConvertParametersGui.R
	fixed bug wher it was using Rtdf_name, but not the associated Rtdf_dir

- ConvertStdf.R
	fixed bug where conversion broke if file had only one device

	now tolerates files that have only PIR/PRR records, allowing wafer maps
	to be generated

	if MPR had no rtn_indx, bug introduced in release 0v6p4, now works again

	strips off "< No Name >" that gets gratuitously added to testnames
	in LTX R14.4.1 and possibly other releases.

	added option for LTX/enVision files where everything after "/" can be stripped
	off the testnames
	
- ConvertEDL.R
	fixed bug where conversion broke if file had only one device

	now doesn't choke if functional patterns have per pin pass information
	turned on.  (which should really be turned off, but if it is on, you still
	want to be able to convert the file)
	
	now supports multisite EDL files

- ConvertJ9.R, ConvertA5xx.R
	fixed bug where conversion broke if file had only one device

- ConvertStdfGui.R
	fixed bug where using Output_dir instead of Rtdfs_dir

	now recognizes .std as well as .stdf as an extension that can be 
	replaced with .rtdf, previously would create xxxxx.std.rtdf files

- SplitConditions.R
	forces casting to numeric of conditions vectors.  sometimes it would 
	give an error when list of numeric

- RtdfTransform.R
	added log transform options -1 and -2 for inverse 10*log10 and 20*log10

- WaferMap.R, WaferMapGui.R
	added option to print "NOTCH" on the wafer maps

	adjusted 2nd multi-pass bin green colour... on some monitors/
	graphics cards, the colour isn't that different from the 1st
	colour.

	parametric maps for all tests now more tolerant of occasional test
	with junk data, or with files with bad sbin or hbin data

- SplitBySubstrGui.R
	input browse button went to wrong directory

- SplitBySubstr.R
	originally required substring to be surrounded by "_" or else
	be at end of testname.  Now doesn't require an "_" after it,
	just something that isn't alphanumeric [0-9a-zA-Z]

- TkRadar.R and TkRadarDefaultsGui.R
	updated to reflect above additions and changes

- xxxxGui.R
	now check to see if Vista or Vista with lipstick (aka Windows7),
	and reverse order of browse file type list since these interpret
	the list backwards compared to Linux, Windows XP, Windows 2000, Mac, etc...

- ConvertParameters.R
	now tolerates units of "NA"

- PlotRtdf.R and PlotRtdfGui.R
	add options to have a superimposed histogram as well as individual ones

	add option to plot to widest of either limits or values

	autoscale flag can now be turned off

- TkRadarDefaultsGui.R
	added variables for...
	directories: frugal and hp9400

	auto open pdf files for various scripts that generate pdf files

	new options added to asciiwafermap, plotrtdf, wafermap

===================================================================
Version 0v6p4 -- 21Jan10
===================================================================

New Features:
=============
- AsciiWaferMap.R
	Generates an ascii version of a wafermap from an .rtdf file
	that is acceptable by most assembly houses.


Improvements and Fixes:
=======================
- Various .R
	exists() changed to exists(...,inherits=FALSE) to keep variable
	search to within the particular scripts namesspace

- Various GUI.R
	originally were all sharing the pdf_name variable, now each
	window has its own local pdf_name variable.

- ConvertStdf.R
	Fix bug where ResultsMatrix ended up being a vector instead of  
	a matrix if the stdf file only contained one device run.  
	
	Now tolerates if MPR record has more results than pins

	Now supports MPR records where only the first occurence has
	limits and pin information

	Now has option to support duplicate testnames 

	Now has option to not ignore MPR records with invalid pass/fail flags
	(some Credence programs)

- MergeRtdf.R & MergeRtdfGui.R (& .Rprofile & TkRadarDefaultsGui.R)
	added support to enable/disable appending extra tests if these  
	tests don't exist in the first file but do in any of the other
	ones to be merged.

	Drastically improve speed if merged files contain a lot of devices

	Now also merges Sbin and Hbin InfoFrames rather than just 
	using the Frame from the first file.

- ConvertCsv.R
	Fixed bug where it didn't create a proper csv file if the
	rtdf file was a "merged" one that had multiple LotInfoFrame
	rows.

	Now tolerates scaler = NA

- ConvertCsvGui.R
	Fixed bug introduced in previous release that broke the output
	file browse button behaviour.

	Now has separate rtdf in and out directory fields

- TkRadar.R
	starting directory for directory browsing now behaves
	as intended.

- WaferMap.R
	now uses SbinInfoFrame or HbinInfoFrame pass/fail bin type 
	information if available when determining pass status
	of bins if pass bins are not explicitly set.  Previously,
	it just assumed bin 1 for hbins, or sbins that corresponded
	to hbin=1.

	now will generate parametric wafer maps for all tests if parameter field
	is empty

- ConvertEDL.R
	added support for yet another test method format variant
	pinname PASSED [value1 units .. value2 units]
	
- ShrinkRetests.R
	can now optionally use x_coord and y_coord rather than
	part_id to determine if the device is a retest.

- PlotTestVsTest.R & PlotTestVsTestGui.R
	add option to send output to .png file 

- TkRadarDefaultsGui.R
	add "clear" button to subdirectories in Directories tab

- All xxxGui.R
	- if generating RTDF files, now outputs to Rtdfs_dir, not Output_dir
	- explicitly sets directory rather than assuming in correct directory
	- use paste(tclObj()) instead of as.character(tclObj()), now handles
	  empty strings, strings with spaces, etc properly
	- TkRadar.log file will consistently be appended to in the same directory
	  the script is writing its other output to.

Retired:
========
removed JustBin1s - This is the default settings for FilterByBinning
	which does this and more.

===================================================================
Version 0v6p3b -- 2Nov09
===================================================================

Improvements and Fixes:
=======================
- MergeRtdfGui.R
	updated code for multiple file selection hadn't fully
	propagated to this function.



===================================================================
Version 0v6p3 -- 1Nov09
===================================================================

New Features:
=============
- Documentation
	
- ReplaceTestnames.R
	Primarily for J9 files, will use reference .rtdf file to change
	testnames based on matching test numbers.  Generate one rtdf 
	file from the ascii datalog which has intact testnames, and
	then when processing stdf files for that j9 program, use this
	reference .rtdf to correctly set the testnames since the j9
	stdf files do not contain proper testnames.

- ControlCharts.R
	Generates control charts in .pdf format from an .rtdf file

- TkRadar.log
	TkRadar commands are now logged to a text file with timestamps,
	with the option to turn off this logging.

- No_Vlo_Vhi.R
	semi-custom script for stripping off _VHI and _VLO from end of
	testnames.  Useful example code for doing similar things.

- Conditions - ConvertStdf, ConvertCsv, SplitConditions 
	ConvertStdf now can treat parametric tests that have testnames
	beginning with "CONDITION=" as conditions rather than tests.
	ConvertCsv has been updated to support arbitrarily defined
	conditions, and SplitConditions.R has been added that will
	split an RTDF file into multiple files based on conditions.

- TkDefaultsGui.R
	allows you to load and save directories and default settings in 
	settings files so that you can quickly and easily switch between 
	different products


Improvements and Fixes:
=======================
- PlotTestvsTest
	tidied up some tk and environment variable behaviours

- RemoveDevicesAtIndices
	made "Indices Entry" parser a little more lenient, numbers
	can be separated by spaces, commas or both

- RemoveDevicesAtIndicesGui
	removed extraneous line in code that caused error message
	and stopped the window from 'RUN & QUIT'ing properly

- FilterByResultsGui
	fixed bug where it didn't update the default rtdf filename
	after running, but instead printed an error message in 
	the R console

- WaferMap
	* added hbin support as well as existing sbin and parameter options
	* added multiple pass bin support
	* increased color binning to 9 pass and 9 fail bins (was 1 and 6)
	* now handles LotInfoFrame of length>1 
	* auto shrinks font of Lot/Yield line if it gets too long for page

- WaferMapGui
	* added some defaults to .Rprofile for per user customization
	* added output_dir field to window so it is now more consistent
	  with the other windows

- MergeRtdfGui
	* fix typo that prevented GUI from actually sending the
	  MergeRtdf command to the console
	* added in_file directory browser
	* file browsing should work as expected now

- ConvertStdf
	filter out <CR>s from lot_id, sublot_id and wafer_id if they
	exist.  (an occasional 93K'ism)

- ConvertStdfGui
	* added some defaults to .Rprofile for per user customization
	* stdf_browser now consistently starts browsing from the correct
	  directory

- PlotRtdfGui
	added some defaults to .Rprofile for per user customization

- .Rprofile
	added quite a few more default variables to this file to
	allow more user customization.

- removed obsoleted functions from the package
	FindDevices.R 
	RemoveDevices.R
	RemoveResults.R
	FilterDevices.R

- RtdfTransformGui, ReplaceTestnamesGui, FilterByResultGui, and
	FilterbyBinningGui
	out_file browsing was using "Open" instead of "Save" browser.
	so you could only select existing names via the browser

- ConvertJ9
	* append testnumber to testname since testnames aren't always
	  unique otherwise.
	* now properly initializes LotInfoFrame for files where
	  the header is missing
	* should run about 20% faster now

- ConvertXXXXXGui
	various convert windows and the ExpandMPRsGui too have 
	been modified to allow you to select multiple files at 
	once.  Also they no longer clobber their input directories
	on opening or resetting defaults.

	ConvertStdfGui
	ConvertA5xxGui
	ConvertEDLGui
	ConvertJ9Gui
	ExpandMPRsGui
	ConvertCsvGui
	MergeRtdfGui

- ConvertEDL
	* now handles if testnumbers aren't turned on
	* now handles Pin Results where: [pinname] PASSED P = result
	* now recognized parametic tests which don't have Pin Results
	* now properly initializes LotInfoFrame for files where
	  the header is missing
	* should run about 33% faster now

- PlotRtdf
	only plotted tests found in the first RTDF file.  Will now 
	plot all tests found in any of the RTDF files unless a
	parameters file is specified.

- directory browser
	called by various windows, now uses choose.dir if in 
	windows instead of tkchooseDirectory.  tkchooseDirectory
	in windows doesn't support resizing (but works ok in linux). 
	(tcltk v8.5)

- ConvertA5xx
	* now properly initializes LotInfoFrame for files where
	  the header is missing
	* should run about 10% faster now


===================================================================
Version 0v6p2 -- 21Jun09
===================================================================

New Features:
=============
- FilterByBinning.R
	A more generic version of JustBin1s, that allow you to 
	specify one or more bins.

- ConvertCsv.R
	Dumps the 4 main objects of the rtdf file into a single CSV
	file for viewing and modifying in a spreadsheet.  It can
	also read in a CSV file in that format and generate the
	respective RTDF file.

- RtdfTransform.R
	In its most basic use, it allows you to translate test names/
	numbers for comparing similar data from different test 
	systems by way of a CSV formatted command file.  It also allows 
	you to create new rtdf files with tests that are transforms of 
	tests and data of an existing rtdf file.
	ie.  create a test R_PULLUP from an IIL test, or convert 
	voltage to dBm

- TkRadar.R
	Add Gui interfaces for the above new commands.  Also, window
	was getting a bit long, so change some of the buttons to 
	detachable menus ("tearoff")

- .Rprofile
	add call to TkRadar(), so it starts automatically

- Radar.R
	add the above 3 new scripts to Radar package


Improvements and Fixes:
=========================
- TkRadar
	When adding ConvertA5xxGui to TkRadar in 0v6p1, inadvertently removed 
	sourcing of ConvertEDLGui.R...  put missing line back in

- WaferMap
	forgot to add updated version to 0v6p1 package... does
	a better job of ignoring bad coordinates or bin name info
	rather than crashing.

- ConvertEDL.R
	now works with wafer sort EDL files too.

- ConvertStdf.R
	- for J9 generated files which don't seem to have proper testnames,
	  build names from function name + test number so that they are
	  unique
	- properly initialize testnumbers array each run, fixes bug
	  when running multiple times in a session on files that
	  don't have testnames in the PTR/FTR/MPRs
	- suppress warning messages for a535 files where SBR pass/fail
	  flag is empty rather than "p" or "f"
	- added code to support STDF v3.. but have no example files to
	  verify debug, so it probably doesn't work.

- FilterByResultGui.R, MergeRtdfGui.R,
	now updates default rtdf file name to newly created file,
	similar to other rtdf generating windows	


===================================================================
Version 0v6p1 -- 12Mar09
===================================================================

New Features:
=============
- ConvertA5xx - for when you have the A500 or Catalyst .data file, but
	not the .stdf file.  This will import the data from the .data
	file



Improvements and Fixes:
=========================
- ConvertStdf 
	- would choke if gzip'ed compression was better than 20x,
	  backed off error checking to 30x.
	- SbinInfoFrame, HbinInfoFrame, summary file weren't properly
	  cleared, so would sometimes be wrong if doing multiple
	  ConvertStdf runs in same session.
	
- PlotRtdfGui 
	- fixed bug with browse vs. empty output pdf file name
	- added the add_normal_curve default to ones that can be
	  personalized in the .Rprofile

- PlotRtdf 
	- increased error checking for when the do_guardbands or
	  do_xy_plots flags are set, but there is only a single
	  data set.  Now prints a warning and turns off option
	  rather than cryptic internal message and crashing.


===================================================================
Version 0V6 -- 25Feb09
===================================================================

New Features:
=============
- cleaned up R workspace, putting all the RADAR
	local variables and functions into hidden
	environments, resolving variable contention
	issues, adding top level RADAR scripts to
	commands search path

- added SaveRtdf and LoadRtdf to TkRadar to allow easier
	manual edits of datasets

- added DevicesFrame field for multisite, added SplitSites
	function to separate data based on site.

- added support for per-user setting of some of the
	default values in PlotRtdf such as:
	* min_plots_per_page
	* use_OOCalc_csv
	* use_csv_formulas

- added ExpandMPRs, converts multipin MPR records into a series
  of PTR records and outputs in STDF format.  For those people
  who insist on using dataPOWER with 93K/HPUX stdf files.

- added ConvertEDL for 93K/HPUX programs that have >128 tests in
  a test method.  The stdf files only contain the first 128 tests
  per test method.  (93K/Linux versions should be ok).  EDL is the
  ascii output from the EDF binary file.

- added ConvertJ9 for J971 ascii datalogs.  Not a fully featured
  conversion, but good enough for what was needed at the time.



Improvements and Fixes:
=======================
- ConvertStdf 
	* now runs significantly faster for files with
	  many tests per device (>2K tests).
	* for MPR records with no pinlist, generates place
	  holder names no_pin1, no_pin2, etc...
	* now properly supports interleaved multisite data. 

- FilterByResult now works properly when filtering by
  device (did the opposite before!)

- JustBin1s now writes all the optional rtdf objects too if present in 
  original file

- PlotRtdf now gracefully reduces font size when testnames are so
  long they would overlap limits

- PlotTestvsTest now has flag to print "part_id" field beside each point in 
  plot

- SplitWafers now passes on TSRFrame

- TkRadar
	* setting default output directory should 
	  work more consistently now
	* ConvertStdf - tidy up auto name completion
	  between stdf and rtdf file, also with
	  other windows
	* FilterByResult - properly works when units
	  scalar is ""
	* PlotTestvsTest - y axis units now correct
	* RemoveDevicesAtIndices - accepts spaces and/or
	  commas separating values in list
