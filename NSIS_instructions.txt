The goal
========
Use NSIS to create an install.exe file for RADAR for windows.


Issues with Windows Vista and later, with the new sysadmin stuff.  
Haven't been able to get around the wanting to run at 2 levels:
- sysadmin level, all users, for installing R if it hasn't been installed
- user level, for installing the RADAR folder, and desktop shortcut
It worked fine in WindowsXP, but yet to figure out the 'correct' way now.

so....

for now, just check if R has been installed.  If not, error message and quit.


Installing NSIS
===============
nsis-2.46-setup.exe from nsis.sourceforge.net

...also need to install UAC.dll to /Program Files (x86)/NSIS/Plugins?
...also need to install inetc.dll...

...see http://nsis.sourceforge.net/How_can_I_install_a_plugin

UAC.zip from nsis.sourceforge.net/UAC_plug-in (v0.2.4 20111123)
Inetc.zip from nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in (v?? 20090804)

	copy UAC.dll to .../NSIS/Plugins
	copy UAC.nsh to .../NSIS/Include

	copy inetc.dll to .../NSIS/Plugins
	
	
How to use NSIS...
==================
Make an NSIS version of the .Rprofile with variable name substitution...


click on .nsi file and right click to get menu option to compile NSIS script
(I must have installed NSIS software to get this!)
(Or if using wine, drag and drop .nsi file onto NSIS compiler window)

the RADAR package folder must be in the same folder as the .nsi file.

(please keep a copy of the .nsi file and these instructions in the RADAR
 package folder also)
